# DesignPatterns

## The Facade Pattern

the intent of the Facade pattern is to

> Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.
> Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

## The Adapter Pattern

the intent of the Adapter pattern is to

> Convert the interface of a class into another interface that the clients expect. 
> Adapter lets classes work together that could not otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

## The Strategy Pattern

The Strategy patten's intent is to 
> Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable.
> Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.


## The Bridge Pattern

the intent of the Bridge pattern is to 

> Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.

## The Abstract Factory Pattern

the intent of the Abstract factory pattern is to 
> Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

## The Decorator Pattern

the Decorator pattern's intent is to 
> Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. 
> Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.


## The Observer Pattern

The intent of the Observer patern is to 

> Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

## The Template Method Pattern

The intent of the Template Method pattern is as follows:

> Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses.
> Redefine the steps in an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.


## The Singleton Pattern

the Singleton's intent is to 

> Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.

## The Factory Method Pattern

The intent of the Factory Method is to

> Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
> Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.
